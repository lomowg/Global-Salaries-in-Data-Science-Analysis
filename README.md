# Global Salaries in AI, ML, Data Science
In this project, I have analyzed a Data Science salary dataset. The study includes general data statistics and visualization of salary distribution, the amount of data by experience level, type of employment, company location and other parameters. At the end, I made some conclusions regarding salaries. Dataset taken from the Kaggle: [Global Salaries in AI, ML, Data Science](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aijobs/global-salaries-in-ai-ml-data-science/data)
